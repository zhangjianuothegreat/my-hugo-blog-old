I’m Jake Miller, a history major from a dead-end Ohio town off Route 23, where the factories rusted out and the Buckeyes are the only thing keeping us sane. I’ve got a master’s from Ohio State that’s collecting dust, $1,200 in Navient debt breathing down my neck, and a one-star Upwork review from a $50 gig I botched in Philly. 

Back in my hometown (pop. 3,000), I’m teaching myself Python, screwing up PTA workshops, and building dinky sites like Jerry’s Diner. I’m no tech bro—just a guy stumbling through code, dodging Tammy’s gossip at Dollar General, and dreaming of something bigger than Taco Bell runs and Navient calls. 

Ohio Code Dreams is my story: the fails, the fights, and the faint hope I might actually make it as a coder. Stick around for the mess. Follow me on X #OhioCodeDreams
