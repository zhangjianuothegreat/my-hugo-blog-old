featured_image: &#34;/images/ohio-coding-diner.jpg&#34;Starting from Zero: Ohio History Grad’s Coding JourneyFrom Ohio History Grad to Coding NewbieMay 2020. I clutched my history master’s over a glitchy Zoom stage, 26 and cocky, ready to lecture on the Tea Act or Shakespeare’s tobacco (harsh New World leaf). I pictured dusty archives or teaching Ohio undergrads about the Articles of Confederation. Wrong. The world needed ventilators, Zoom accounts, and coders for toilet paper apps.The pandemic hit like a Rust Belt factory closing—fast, brutal. My Philly Fishtown shoebox, split with Jake, my poli-sci roommate, cost $1,600 a month. My $40,000 Navient debt was a guillotine, the grace period ticking like a bomb. I slung burgers near Temple for $12 an hour, tips barely buying a Yuengling. COVID shut the diner to takeout-only. Customers vanished. My boss, Tony, a chain-smoking pancake flipper, got sick and didn’t make it. His wife, Maria, followed. I poured coffee for Uber drivers, dodging the news’ body count.Why Learn to Code in a Rust Belt Town?Every night, I came home reeking of fryer grease, sneakers caked in diner sludge, firing off resumes. Museums, libraries, nonprofits—nothing. The academic job market, a Hunger Games pre-COVID, was now a wasteland. I refreshed Gmail like a slot machine, craving even a rejection. Twitter screamed death tolls: “3,000 dead today.” “No end in sight.” On our Craigslist couch, nursing a warm Yuengling, I wondered how to pay rent in a collapsing world.History gives perspective—Spanish Flu, Black Death—but didn’t loosen Navient’s chokehold. I ran numbers: $450 monthly payments post-deferment, $800 rent, $200 groceries. I cleared $1,200 on a good month. My roommate Jake, with his useless poli-sci degree, split $5 pizzas, joking we’d eat Purina by 30. It wasn’t funny.The Coding LeapBy August, I was pulling double shifts, hands raw from sanitizing tables. Job boards listed software engineers, data analysts, nothing for historians. Museums were padlocked, universities slashed adjuncts. I applied to admin jobs, thinking research skills might translate. No luck. Navient’s letters grew meaner, demanding $300 a month on income-based repayment. I sobbed into a towel, broke.Then coding crept in—not a dream, a last resort. Jake’s cousin, a Seattle tech bro, bragged about his six-figure job. I hated his smug face but envied the paycheck. Tech was hiring. I googled “how to code,” found stories of teachers and bartenders turned coders. I signed up for a free bootcamp, expecting to fail. Variables, loops, syntax errors—it was hell. I’d curse, slam my laptop, but kept going. Navient wouldn’t wait.My First Gig (and Crash)By December, I could write a calculator that didn’t crash. Upwork became my Wild West. I found a gig: a $150 WordPress site for Brenda’s South Philly bakery. I faked confidence, got hired, then panicked. Her cheap hosting spat errors—Permission denied, Database connection failed. I wrestled Stack Overflow, CSS, SMTP plugins. The site was a mess: text spilled, images stretched. Brenda disputed, left a 1-star review: “Unreliable, site’s a mess. Avoid.” My hope died.I didn’t touch my laptop for weeks. The diner’s exhaust fan drowned my thoughts. But history taught me persistence. I took a better course, rebuilt Brenda’s site for practice. It wasn’t perfect, but it worked. Spring 2021, I landed a $15/hour WordPress assistant gig. It’s grunt work, fixing plugins, but it’s a crack in the door. I’m not a coder—not yet—but I’m not just a history grad either.Read more about my Ohio coding journey (/about) | Follow on X
